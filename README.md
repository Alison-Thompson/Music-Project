# Music-Project

This is a project for Dixie State University's code school.
The goal is to create a website that is able to generate musical
chord progressions for the user that both sound good and are based on 
user's inputed genre, key, and mode. This site is to be
a song writing tool that can create new and interesting chord progressions.
